Welcome to my land!

For a more **Formal** introduction of me, please click ***[here](about/)*** and ***ignore whatever below***, thanks! 

This is a virtual space of mine (temporarily (well I mean I just rented it from ***[Namesilo](https://www.namesilo.com/)***))!

Actually I think maybe I should had successfully adjusted the font family, chose a great theme or just got everything well prepared before I wrote anything on this page. But unfortunately I... It's... It's really challenging to finish them till the extent I would be satisfied with, not even until the end of the world (or my death if more explicitly). So I decided to desert the perfectionalism and write something.

But still, I hope one day I would perfect this land. Let's see when those boastful wishes would come true (mb never lol).
- Change the font family. Any kind except the present one... (made in 2/27/2024, not started)
- Find a template theme and customize it more personally. (made in 3/10/2024, not started)
- Add a section named *my bass journey* and upload some videos. (made in 3/10/2024, not started)

It's somehow like playing a cultivation games when seeing those "tasks". Maybe there exist someone like masters and could do some in-app purchases to speed up this process. But I might need a huge whale to do so and it's likely to turn out to be no use.

Finally I want to express my thanks to ***[Prof. Qiu](https://statr.me/)***, who inspired me to build this personal website and also I grabbed his homepage as reference. Meanwhile, thanks for ***[Chenrui Wang](https://github.com/Aoblex)***'s powerful assistance during the construction procedure, without whom I might had quitted halfway.
