Hii everyone! Welcome to GrassLand again. 

It's been a year to come back! Here's something about me.

I'm an ordinary undergraduate finding a place to record my life. In this era, there are tremendous ways but I choose this way here, writing blogs in front of my computer. I view it a more formal method compared to publishing posts on social media, where I would be eager and anxious to get others likes and comments. And more meaningful (maybe not) compared to the moments that are only visible to my self lying in my Moments. 

So you can see I'm a bit ambivalent about sharing. Maybe...... I'm just looking for a more harmonious environment, but it's scarce in the current world. Anyway I believe the one who send me an email in real action are those who have deep empathy and can't wait saying something with me. I'm also anticipating interaction with you.

In GrassLand, you can see my notes taken from what I'm learning recently, my tedious nagging about my life, or everything I want to share. Sometimes you might discover that it's been a long time since my last update (actually I suspect the existence of anyone who pays close attention to my homepage). That's quite normal. It's not for I being in any dilemma or coming acorss anything tough. It's probably because I forget this field or too lazy to update. If it's toooooo long, like 30 years, then there's only one reason, I've gone to death. But maybe at that time, this website also has diminished from the internet. 

If any to talk, contact me at...... (Haven't think of which address yet)
